# Python Manager 
#### _Written by Leo Sandler_ <br /> _Course: ICS4U_ <br /> _Teacher: Mr Stubbs_

My AOL submission for unit 3, based upon object oriented programming.

Within this code, you act as the manager for a sports team. You are able to control employees, and the vendors.

I was looking at including the ability to make a player line-up, but did not as I feel like this code has enough functionality within it and proof of my understanding of classes.

The code runs through the perspective of the general manager, with the bulk of functions relating to this class.

## Code Functionality
-  The employees(including age, salary, and position) are stored within a text file.
These employees can have their salary raised or cut. Also, the entire payroll can be viewed. Within this view,
the payroll is sorted from highest to lowest salary. In addition, Employees can be hired or fired.

- The vendors(including their products and product prices) are stored within a text file. The offerings for all vendors
can be viewed. Vendors can be created, or removed. As well, vendor products can be added or removed.

- The information for vendors and employees is modified within the classes and text files after changes are made.

## File Usage
- The text files, _Vendors.txt_ and _Employees.txt_ are utilised within the code.
- They have some pre-existing data which can be modified through the Python Manager program.
